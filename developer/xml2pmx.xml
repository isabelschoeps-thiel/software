DESCRIPTION
xml2pmx translates MusicXML files to input suitable for PMX processing

SYNOPSIS
xml2pmx [−v | −version | −h | −help]
xml2pmx input.xml output.pmx [ p | d | v | s | l ] ..
The musixtex.lua script from version 0.23 supports xml2pmx as a pre-preprocessor for
MusicXML files.

OPTIONS
The meanings of the letter options are as follows:
p XML parser output; not recommended unless the terminal window process has enough
storage
d information on "directions" (dynamical marks etc)
v distribution of voices over instruments and measures
s statistics of MusicXML tags like <note>, <measure> etc
l for extracting lyrics in a separate file

BUGS
xml2pmx processes input in UTF-8 encoding only. MusicXML files in UTF-8 encoding should
be converted using, for example, recode (in Unix-like systems) or by importing into an editor like
notepad and saving in UTF-8 encoding.
